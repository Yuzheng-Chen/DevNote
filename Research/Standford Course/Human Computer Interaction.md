- Should be easy to change
- Gets to retire

## Evaluating Design
### Usability Studies
- Surveys & Focus Groups
- Feedback from Experts
- Participant Observation 
- Simulation & Formal Models
### Issues to Consider
- Reliability / Precision
- Generalizability
- Realism
- Comparison
- Work Involved

## Participant Observation
- What do people do now?
- What values and goals do people have?
- How are these particular activities embedded in a larger ecology?
- Similarities and differences across people
- ...and other types of context, like time of day 

### Apprentice
- Set up a partnership with the people to be observed
- Be taught the steps in the process
- Observe all of the practices
- Validate what you are observing with those observed as you go along

## Interviewing
The Importance of Being Curious
- Everything has stories to tell

Longitudinal or Sporadic Behavior?

 ### Diary Studies
 - Give people a diary that they complete at a specified time or interval
 - Structured task
 - Can use journals, cameras, voice, video
 - Tailor the recording to the context
 - Can scale better than direct observation
 - Easier tools â†’ better results
 - May requires some practice, training, reminding

### Experience Sampling
