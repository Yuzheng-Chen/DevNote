# The Power of Prototyping
- Prototyping is a strategy for efficiently dealing with things that are hard to predict.
- Should not be required to be complete
- Should be easy to change
- Gets to retire

## What Do Prototypes Prototype?

**Feel** 
What might it look like?

**Implementation**
What might it work like?

**Role**
What might the experience be like?

- To use the least time to get the thing you could learn the most.

### Storyboards
- Story boarding is all about tasks.
![[Pasted image 20220627144300.png]]
- Story boarding is about communicating ideas (Always include human)

- Setting
	- People involved
	- Environment
	- Tast being accomplished
- Sequence
	- What steps are involved?
	- What leads someone to use the app?
	- What task is being illustrated?
- Satisfaction
	- What's motivates people to use this system?
	- What does it enable people to accomplish?
	- What need does the system fill?

Benefits of Story boarding
- Holistic focus: Helps emphasize how an interface accomplishes a task
- Avoids commitment to a particular user interface (no buttons yet)
- Helps get all the stakeholders on the same page in terms of the goal

## Faking it
### Wizard of Oz
- ...simulates machine behavior with human operators
- Need to practice first

### Video Prototyping

# Evaluating Design
### Usability Studies
- Surveys & Focus Groups
- Feedback from Experts
- Participant Observation 
- Simulation & Formal Models
### Issues to Consider
- Reliability / Precision
- Generalizability
- Realism
- Comparison
- Work Involved

## Participant Observation
- What do people do now?
- What values and goals do people have?
- How are these particular activities embedded in a larger ecology?
- Similarities and differences across people
- ...and other types of context, like time of day 

### Apprentice
- Set up a partnership with the people to be observed
- Be taught the steps in the process
- Observe all of the practices
- Validate what you are observing with those observed as you go along

## Interviewing
The Importance of Being Curious
- Everything has stories to tell

Longitudinal or Sporadic Behavior?

 ### Diary Studies
 - Give people a diary that they complete at a specified time or interval
 - Structured task
 - Can use journals, cameras, voice, video
 - Tailor the recording to the context
 - Can scale better than direct observation
 - Easier tools â†’ better results
 - May requires some practice, training, reminding

### Experience Sampling

## Creating Design Goals
All design is re-design
- When you are designing, what matters? What should it accomplish?
- Estimate whether different designs are meaningfully different.
- Our goal is to make it explicit.

The outcome of activity analysis
- What are the steps?
- What are the artifacts?
- What are the goals? (how you'll measure)
- What are the [[pain points]]?

Have Multiple related activities
- The same person uses the same design to achieve slightly different things
- Also, different people may do things slightly differently
- Because they have slightly different goals, expertise, ...
- For empathy, keep 'em human
